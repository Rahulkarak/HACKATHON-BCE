<h2 class="white-text" style="color: white;">What's in it for you?</h2><br>
<h3 class="white-text" style="color: white;">
The idea behind these Develepment contests is that we want you to learn while competing. Also we believe that it is alright to refer to tutorials, books and other materials, learn a concept and then apply the same to solve a problem during a contest. But it is not alright to copy other people's solutions or seek other people's help to solve a problem. All the participants are expected to abide to
